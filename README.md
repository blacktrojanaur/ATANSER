Project Vision

ATANSER is designed to secure digital communication over untrusted networks by creating encrypted tunnels and monitoring routing integrity while capturing both live and disk forensics evidence with cryptographic verification and automatic secure rerouting when threats are detected.

🌍 Global Problem It Solves

Modern networks suffer from routing and LAN-level attacks that silently intercept critical communication. ATANSER prevents these threats by continuously fingerprinting trusted network paths, validating integrity via hashing, and autonomously rebuilding secure tunnels over safe alternate routes.

⚔️ Threat Coverage

ARP cache poisoning and spoofing

BGP route table tampering and anomalies

Man-in-the-middle interception of encrypted sessions

Unauthorized port and packet behavior

Unnoticed traffic exhaustion attempts (DDoS patterns)

DLL/Process hooking into communication streams

🔍 Forensic Strength

Live memory capture (RAM, active connections, open files, process state)

Disk-level forensic snapshots (filesystem metadata, deleted block remnants, logs)

Integrity validation using SHA-256 fingerprint logs

Chain of custody-ready evidence logs

⚙️ Concurrency & Performance

High-concurrency real-time monitoring using Go goroutines

Thread-safe global state using mutexes and channels

Low latency secure routing decision engine

🔄 Autonomous Secure Rerouting

When network integrity threats are detected, ATANSER:

Tears down active communication tunnels

Flags compromised routes

Selects alternate safe endpoints

Rebuilds encrypted tunnels

Logs the reroute reason and hash integrity proof

🏙️ Use Case Example

A public infrastructure system or FinTech platform using ATANSER can transmit critical data securely even under active routing attacks while maintaining forensic evidence and automated recovery without human intervention.

💡 Future Patent Claim Angle

ATANSER introduces a novel system combining:

Real-time network attack detection

Encrypted transport tunnels

Live and disk-level forensic evidence hashing

Autonomous threat-aware secure routing and tunnel reconstruction
