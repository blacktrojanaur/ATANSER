## Patent Claim Draft – ATANSER
1. A system that continuously fingerprints trusted network gateway MAC addresses and validates ARP reply integrity in real time.
2. A system that snapshots and hashes routing table state to detect unauthorized path modifications.
3. A secure communication framework that automatically terminates encrypted tunnels when network integrity threats are detected.
4. A self-healing routing engine that selects fallback endpoints and logs cryptographic integrity proof for every route switch.
5. Implemented in Go using high-concurrency parallel monitoring, cryptographic hashing, and autonomous recovery design.
